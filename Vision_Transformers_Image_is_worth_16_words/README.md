ViT - [The State of the Art in Computer Vision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929)

While Transformers replaced RNNs in NLP right away, it tooks time for Computer Vision Applications to make place for multi-head attentions. In this paper, Google Research showed a way to remove the absolute reliance on CNNs in CV, by achieving the state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet as well with substantianlly fewer computational resources.
