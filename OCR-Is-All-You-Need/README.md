OCR has two major building blocks:

> Text detection

Object detection can be done in 2 ways
>> Region-based detectors

Find bounding boxes and then, classify which label this object belongs to. For example, Faster R-CNN.

>> Single shot detectors

Find bounding boxes and do classification at the same time. For example, YOLO.

Here, there is a certain trade-off. Since region-based detectors are more accurate, while single shot detectors are faster.
